# Typora-Themes

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This repo is my typora themes collection folder, which is based on the typora themes folder. It is used to store my self made themes and some other themes that I like. So you can clone this repo to your typora themes folder and use the themes in your typora.

The built-in themes have been excluded by `.gitignore` file.

If you want to use some of the themes, you can download the `.css` file and the corresponding folder, then put it into your typora theme folder.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This repo contains the raw font files.
