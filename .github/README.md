# Typora-Themes

> [!IMPORTANT]

> This repo is my typora themes collection folder. It is used to store my self made themes and some other themes that I like.

The built-in themes have been excluded by `.gitignore` file.

If you want to use some of the themes, you can download the `.css` file and the corresponding folder, then put it into your typora theme folder.
